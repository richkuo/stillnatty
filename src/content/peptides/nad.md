full_description: "NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a critical coenzyme found in all living cells that plays essential roles in cellular metabolism, energy production, DNA repair, and aging processes. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age (up to 50% by middle age), contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced cellular repair capacity, and various age-related conditions. NAD+ serves as a crucial substrate for sirtuins (SIRT1-7) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes that regulate cellular longevity, stress adaptation, and DNA repair mechanisms. While NAD+ itself is poorly absorbed orally, precursor compounds including Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) effectively increase NAD+ levels via salvage pathways. Clinical trials demonstrate NR/NMN supplementation (250-1000mg daily) safely elevates blood NAD+ levels, with observed improvements in mitochondrial function, insulin sensitivity, muscle performance, and cardiovascular markers. However, experts emphasize there is no conclusive evidence that NAD+ supplementation extends human lifespan despite cellular benefits. Common administration methods include oral supplementation (NR/NMN), IV infusions (500-1500mg, 2-4 hours), and subcutaneous injections (50-100mg weekly). Side effects are generally mild and transient, including nausea, flushing, headache, and GI discomfort. Potential concerns include unknown long-term safety profile, theoretical tumorigenesis risk (unproven in humans), and significant cost ($1000+ for IV sessions). NAD+ restoration represents a promising but still investigational approach to cellular regenerative medicine, requiring more robust long-term human clinical trials to establish definitive therapeutic applications and longevity benefits."
