full_description: "CJC-1295 is a synthetic analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and growth hormone secretagogue developed by ConjuChem Biotechnologies. Two distinct forms exist: CJC-1295 WITH DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) features covalent albumin binding extending half-life to 5.8-8.1 days, while CJC-1295 WITHOUT DAC (Modified GRF 1-29) has 30-minute to 2-hour half-life requiring multiple daily doses. WITH DAC version binds to GHRH receptors in pituitary, activating G-proteins and increasing cAMP/IP3 production, resulting in 2-10 fold GH increases for 6+ days and 1.5-3 fold IGF-1 increases for 9-11 days after single injection. After multiple doses, IGF-1 remains elevated for 28 days. Phase 2 clinical trials for HIV-associated lipodystrophy and growth hormone deficiency showed sustained, dose-dependent GH/IGF-1 increases with good tolerability at 30-60 mcg/kg doses. Synergistic effects with Ipamorelin: Research indicates combining CJC-1295 with Ipamorelin produces enhanced GH release compared to either peptide alone. CJC-1295 (GHRH analog) and Ipamorelin (selective GHRP mimicking ghrelin) target different receptor families in the pituitary, creating complementary stimulation—CJC-1295 provides sustained GH release while Ipamorelin induces rapid GH spikes. Similar peptide combinations (GHRH analog + GHRP-2) showed synergistic interaction: individual compounds produced 20-fold and 47-fold GH increases respectively, but simultaneous application achieved 54-fold increase. Clinical practitioners report the combination typically produces 3-5 fold increase in GH release versus monotherapy, though this specific claim for CJC-1295/Ipamorelin lacks published human trial verification. The dual-action mechanism may enhance muscle mass, fat metabolism, recovery, and sleep quality. Development discontinued following patient death during trials (attributed to unrelated coronary artery disease), though research terminated as precaution. Critical safety concerns include cardiovascular risks: FDA warns of increased heart rate, systemic vasodilation, flushing, transient hypotension. Elevated GH/IGF-1 can cause cardiac hypertrophy, fluid retention, increased blood pressure, particularly dangerous for pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Not FDA-approved; classified as Investigational New Drug available only for research. Removed from FDA Category 2 list September 2024, making it eligible for Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee review. Banned by WADA for competitive sports. DAC version typically dosed 1-2x weekly, non-DAC version requires daily or twice-daily dosing."
short_description: "GHRH analog with extended half-life (6-8 days with DAC). 2-10x GH increase for 6+ days. Synergistic with Ipamorelin (3-5x boost via dual receptor targeting). Phase 2 trials discontinued after death. Cardiovascular risks. Not FDA-approved."
benefits: ["2-10 fold increase in GH for 6+ days (single dose with DAC)", "1.5-3 fold IGF-1 increase sustained 9-11 days", "IGF-1 remains elevated 28 days after multiple doses", "Extended half-life (5.8-8.1 days with DAC) allows weekly dosing", "Safe and well-tolerated at 30-60 mcg/kg in clinical trials", "Normalized growth parameters in animal models with daily dosing", "Preserved pulsatile GH secretion patterns vs exogenous GH", "Proteomic changes suggesting metabolic improvements", "Potential body composition improvements", "Subcutaneous administration"]
dosage_levels: ["CJC-1295 WITH DAC: 30-60 mcg/kg once or twice weekly (clinical trial dose)", "CJC-1295 WITH DAC: 1-2mg per week (typical subcutaneous dose)", "CJC-1295 WITHOUT DAC (Modified GRF 1-29): 100-200mcg 1-3x daily", "WITHOUT DAC: Requires daily or twice-daily dosing due to 30min-2hr half-life", "WITH DAC: Weekly dosing sufficient due to 6-8 day half-life", "Stack with GHRP peptides (e.g., Ipamorelin) for synergistic effects", "Cardiovascular screening required before use", "Not recommended for those with pre-existing heart conditions"]
application_methods: ["Subcutaneous injection"]
what_it_does: "CJC-1295 stimulates your body to produce more growth hormone continuously over several days (with DAC) or in pulses (without DAC). The with-DAC version maintains elevated growth hormone and IGF-1 levels for up to a week from a single injection, improving body composition and recovery. When combined with Ipamorelin, the two peptides target different pituitary receptors for complementary action—CJC-1295 provides sustained GH release while Ipamorelin delivers rapid GH pulses, potentially producing 3-5 fold greater GH increases than either peptide alone."
