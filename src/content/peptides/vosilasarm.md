description: "Vosilasarm (RAD140/EP0062) is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) originally developed by Radius Health, now under development by Ellipses Pharma for hormone-sensitive breast cancer (AR+/ER+/HER2-). Potent, orally-active, nonsteroidal SARM with high androgen receptor affinity (Ki = 7 nM vs 29 nM for testosterone). Exhibits tissue-selective activity: acts as agonist in skeletal muscle and bone (anabolic effects), but antagonist in prostate and breasts (blocking AR activation and cellular proliferation). EP0062 reformulation shows markedly improved bioavailability versus original RAD140. Clinical trials in breast cancer demonstrated 58% stable disease rate and 21% clinical benefit rate at â‰¥6 months, with marked CA15-3 suppression in 26% of heavily pre-treated patients. Maximum tolerated dose 100mg daily, with 10mg BID selected as optimal Phase 2 dose. Originally developed for sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and cancer cachexia but development discontinued for these indications. Preclinical data showed 90% anabolic potency of testosterone and >10% weight gain in 28 days at 0.1mg/kg in primates. Concerning safety profile includes documented liver toxicity cases, elevated liver enzymes, 50% testosterone suppression in primates, and negative impacts on skeletal muscle adaptation, frailty, and mortality risk in animal studies. Not FDA-approved; investigational use only in clinical trials. Banned by WADA and illegal for non-medical use in many jurisdictions. Black market products (5-30mg daily doses) pose significant health risks with unknown purity and contaminants."
