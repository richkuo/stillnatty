full_description: "IGF-1 LR3 (Long Arg3 Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1) is a synthetic 83-amino acid analog of human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), engineered with an arginine substitution at position 3 and an additional 13 amino acids at the N-terminus. These structural modifications significantly reduce its binding affinity to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), resulting in an extended half-life of approximately 20-30 hours (compared to native IGF-1's ~10 minutes) and roughly three times greater biological potency than endogenous IGF-1. The peptide functions by binding to IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) on various cell types, initiating complex intracellular signaling cascades through the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways that promote cellular proliferation, differentiation, protein synthesis, and cell survival while inhibiting apoptosis. IGF-1 LR3 has been extensively studied in preclinical research for its powerful anabolic effects, including stimulation of muscle hypertrophy through satellite cell activation, enhanced nitrogen retention and protein synthesis, accelerated tissue repair and regeneration, improved fat metabolism and lean mass development, potential neuroprotective effects through neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic benefits through enhanced glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. Due to its structural similarity to insulin, it also demonstrates some insulin-like metabolic effects. However, IGF-1 LR3 carries significant risks including hypoglycemia (especially with continuous high dosing), potential increased cancer risk due to cellular proliferation effects, muscle and joint pain, and other side effects. It is not FDA-approved for therapeutic use, is classified as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and remains strictly designated for research purposes only. The compound requires careful handling, proper reconstitution with bacteriostatic water, and refrigerated storage."

what_it_does: "IGF-1 LR3 is a modified version of insulin-like growth factor that lasts much longer in your body. It stimulates muscle cells to grow and multiply, speeds up protein building, and helps burn fat, making it extremely powerful for muscle growth but with significant risks including low blood sugar."
