description: "Tirzepatide is an FDA-approved dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist manufactured by Eli Lilly as Mounjaro (type 2 diabetes, 2.5-15mg weekly) and Zepbound (obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, 2.5-15mg weekly). Unique imbalanced agonist with greater GIP receptor engagement than GLP-1, plus biased GLP-1 agonism favoring cAMP generation over β-arrestin recruitment, enhancing insulin secretion. SURMOUNT trials demonstrated exceptional weight loss: 20.9% at 72 weeks (15mg dose), with 50-57% of participants achieving ≥20% weight loss. SURMOUNT-4 showed 25.3% mean weight reduction long-term. Unprecedented diabetes efficacy in SURPASS trials with HbA1c reductions of 1.9-2.6% and weight loss of 6.6-13.9kg, superior to semaglutide 1mg. December 2024 FDA approval as first medication for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, reducing breathing disruptions by 25-29 per hour (5x more effective than placebo). Cardiovascular meta-analysis showed HR 0.80 for MACE-4, with SURPASS-4 showing HR 0.50 at 15mg dose. Common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea 16.24% vs 8.63% placebo), typically mild-to-moderate, transient, occurring during dose escalation. 2024 systematic review found no association with pancreatitis. Gradual titration every 4 weeks (2.5mg steps) minimizes adverse events. Available in 6 strengths: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 12.5mg, 15mg."
