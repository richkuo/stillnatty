description: "Sermorelin acetate (also known as GHRH 1-29 or GRF 1-29) is a synthetic peptide analog of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) that mimics the first 29 amino acids of naturally occurring GHRH. It functions as a growth hormone secretagogue by binding to GHRH receptors on the anterior pituitary gland, stimulating the natural production and pulsatile release of growth hormone (GH) in a physiologically appropriate manner. FDA-approved by the FDA in 1997 under the brand name Geref for diagnosing growth hormone deficiency in children, with manufacturer discontinued production in 2008 for commercial reasons. Unlike direct human growth hormone (rhGH) injection which can cause unnaturally elevated levels and associated side effects, sermorelin stimulates endogenous GH secretion through natural feedback mechanisms regulated by somatostatin, reducing risk of overdose and adverse effects. Currently available through compounding pharmacies for off-label use in adults. While primarily studied in pediatric populations, emerging research explores its potential for adult age-related growth hormone decline, muscle maintenance, body composition, sleep quality, and anti-aging applications. However, conclusive evidence in healthy adult populations remains limited and requires further clinical research."
short_description: "Synthetic GHRH peptide stimulating natural GH secretion via pituitary receptor activation. FDA-approved for pediatric GH deficiency diagnosis. Limited adult clinical data, available via compounding."
benefits: ["Stimulates natural growth hormone production and pulsatile secretion", "Maintains physiological GH release patterns through somatostatin feedback", "May improve lean body mass and body composition in aging populations", "Potential improvements in sleep quality and recovery", "Enhanced energy levels and vitality", "Anti-aging potential through natural GH stimulation", "Safer than direct rhGH administration with natural feedback regulation", "May support pituitary function and endocrine health", "Less risk of supraphysiological GH levels compared to direct GH injection", "Diagnostic tool for assessing growth hormone secretion capacity"]
dosage_levels: ["Diagnostic use: 1mcg/kg body weight, single subcutaneous injection", "Pediatric growth deficiency: 0.03mg/kg daily subcutaneous", "Off-label adult use: 1-2mg subcutaneous daily (evidence limited)", "Typical range: 1-3mg daily, usually administered before bed", "Administration: Subcutaneous injection, may be daily or multiple times weekly", "Best taken before bed for improved sleep and recovery", "Cycle: Typically 8-16 weeks with monitoring"]
application_methods: ["Subcutaneous injection"]
what_it_does: "Sermorelin signals your pituitary gland to produce more growth hormone naturally, following your body's normal rhythms. This helps improve sleep, muscle maintenance, energy levels, and may support anti-aging effects without the risks of directly injecting growth hormone."
