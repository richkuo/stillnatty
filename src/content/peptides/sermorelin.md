description: Sermorelin acetate, also known as GHRH (1-29), is a peptide analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) which is used as a diagnostic agent to assess growth hormone (GH) secretion for the purpose of diagnosing growth hormone deficiency. It is a 29-amino acid polypeptide representing the 1â€“29 fragment from endogenous human GHRH, thought to be the shortest fully functional fragment of GHRH.
