full_description: "CJC-1295/Ipamorelin is a synergistic peptide combination pairing a GHRH analog (CJC-1295) with a selective ghrelin receptor agonist (Ipamorelin) to optimize growth hormone release through complementary mechanisms. CJC-1295 exists in two forms: WITH DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) featuring 5.8-8.1 day half-life via albumin binding, and WITHOUT DAC (Modified GRF 1-29) with 30-minute to 2-hour half-life. Ipamorelin is a synthetic pentapeptide (Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH2) highly selective for GHS-R1a without affecting cortisol, prolactin, ACTH, or acetylcholine. Synergistic mechanism: The peptides target different receptor families in the pituitary gland—CJC-1295 binds GHRH receptors activating G-proteins and increasing cAMP/IP3, while Ipamorelin activates GHS-R1a via phospholipase C generating IP3/DAG and mobilizing intracellular calcium. This dual-action produces sustained GH elevation (CJC-1295) plus rapid pulsatile spikes (Ipamorelin). Research on similar GHRH analog + GHRP combinations showed synergistic effects: individual peptides produced 20-fold and 47-fold GH increases respectively, but simultaneous application achieved 54-fold increase. Clinical practitioners report CJC-1295/Ipamorelin typically produces 3-5 fold greater GH release versus monotherapy, though this specific combination lacks published human trial verification. Monotherapy data: CJC-1295 WITH DAC produces 2-10 fold GH increases for 6+ days and 1.5-3 fold IGF-1 increases for 9-11 days after single injection; IGF-1 remains elevated 28 days after multiple doses. Phase 2 trials showed dose-dependent GH/IGF-1 increases at 30-60 mcg/kg with good tolerability but development discontinued after patient death (attributed to unrelated coronary disease). Ipamorelin showed dose-dependent GH increases and bone growth in preclinical studies but Phase 2 trials for post-operative ileus failed to show efficacy. The combination may enhance muscle mass, fat metabolism, recovery, and sleep quality through optimized GH pulsatility and sustained elevation. Critical safety concerns: Cardiovascular risks include increased heart rate, systemic vasodilation, flushing, transient hypotension, potential cardiac hypertrophy, fluid retention, and elevated blood pressure—particularly dangerous with pre-existing heart conditions. Ipamorelin has minimal side effects (injection site reactions, mild headache, nausea) that typically resolve in 1-2 weeks and does not suppress endogenous hormone production. Neither peptide is FDA-approved; both classified as Investigational New Drugs for research only. CJC-1295 removed from FDA Category 2 list September 2024. Ipamorelin removed from FDA compounding list September 2024 due to nominator withdrawal; FDA recommended against 503A inclusion October 2024 due to insufficient safety data. Both banned by WADA for competitive sports. Typical combination dosing: CJC-1295 WITH DAC 1-2mg weekly + Ipamorelin 200-300mcg 1-3x daily; WITHOUT DAC requires daily dosing alongside Ipamorelin."
