description: "Semaglutide is an FDA-approved GLP-1 receptor agonist with 94% structural homology to human GLP-1, manufactured by Novo Nordisk as Ozempic (diabetes, 0.25-2mg weekly injection), Wegovy (obesity, up to 2.4mg weekly injection), and Rybelsus (diabetes, 3-14mg daily oral). Activates GLP-1 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and brain to reduce appetite, delay gastric emptying, increase insulin release, and lower glucagon secretion. STEP trials demonstrated 14.9-17.4% mean weight loss at 68 weeks (2.4mg dose), with 69-79% achieving ≥10% weight loss. STEP UP trial showed 20.7% weight loss with 7.2mg dose at 72 weeks. SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial showed 20% reduction in major adverse cardiac events (HR 0.80) in patients with obesity and preexisting cardiovascular disease but without diabetes. FDA-approved March 2024 for reducing cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke risk. Also approved for metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Most common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea affecting up to 20%, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation), typically transient and mild-to-moderate. Notable concerns include possible gastroparesis, 85% increased risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), and thyroid cancer warnings from rodent studies (though human incidence <1%). Available in both injection (89% bioavailability) and oral forms (0.4-1% bioavailability). Gradual titration over 12-16 weeks minimizes gastrointestinal side effects."
