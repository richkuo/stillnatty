description: "BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound-157) is a synthetic 15-amino acid pentadecapeptide derived from a protective protein found in human gastric juice. It works by promoting angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), enhancing growth hormone receptor expression, and reducing inflammatory cytokines. Primarily researched for accelerating tissue repair, wound healing, gut health, and musculoskeletal injury recovery. BPC-157 has shown robust regenerative and cytoprotective effects in preclinical animal studies, particularly for tendon, ligament, muscle injuries, and gastrointestinal disorders. However, human clinical evidence remains extremely limited with only three small pilot studies conducted to date. It is not FDA-approved for therapeutic use and is classified as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). While generally well-tolerated in animal studies, quality control concerns exist as it remains an unregulated compound. BPC-157 is considered investigational and requires more comprehensive human clinical trials to establish safety, efficacy, and proper clinical applications."
