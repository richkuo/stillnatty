description: Retatrutide (LY-3437943) is an experimental drug for obesity developed by the American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company. It is a triple glucagon hormone receptor agonist. It has been shown to achieve a more than 17.5% mean weight reduction in adults without diabetes but with obesity or preobesity (overweight) during a phase 2 trial. In the trial, the participants who received the highest dose showed a mean weight reduction of 24.2% after 48 weeks. Retatrutide is currently in phase 3 clinical trials, one of many GLP-1 receptor agonists in development.
