    question: "What does 'natty' mean?",
    answer: "Natty (short for 'natural') refers to achieving fitness results without using performance-enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids, growth hormone, or other banned substances. In the fitness community, being natty means building muscle and improving performance through natural methods like diet, training, and recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "Are peptides considered natty?",
    answer: "Most peptides are NOT considered natty by natural bodybuilding federations and WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency). While some therapeutic peptides like BPC-157 may be used for healing purposes, they still fall outside the traditional definition of natural bodybuilding. The natty status depends on the specific peptide and its intended use."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if a peptide is natty or not?",
    answer: "Check if the peptide is on WADA's prohibited substances list, review natural bodybuilding federation rules, and consider whether it provides an unnatural performance advantage. Generally, if a substance significantly enhances performance beyond what's achievable naturally, it's not considered natty. Each peptide on Still Natty has a clear natty status indicator based on these criteria."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between natty and enhanced?",
    answer: "Natty athletes rely solely on natural methods (diet, training, sleep, legal supplements like protein powder and creatine) to build muscle and improve performance. Enhanced athletes use performance-enhancing drugs or peptides that provide advantages beyond natural capabilities. The line can be debated, but most peptides that significantly boost performance are considered 'enhanced' territory."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use peptides for medical purposes and still be natty?",
    answer: "This is a grey area in the fitness community. Some argue that therapeutic use of peptides like BPC-157 for injury recovery doesn't count against natty status since it's for healing, not performance enhancement. However, most strict natural bodybuilding organizations would still classify this as non-natty. The intent and context matter."
